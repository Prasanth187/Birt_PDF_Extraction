available in which case a different but appropriate benchmark will be presented. Indices are unmanaged. Past results are not indicative of future results. All results greater than 1 year are annualized.
Account results: exclude private equity funds, but such assets are included in the Portfolio Summary section. Results are presented before the deduction of separately managed investment management, advisory, non-advisory and all

capital gain distributions are recognized according to the ex-date.
Effective September 16, 2022, each of the PCS Core Bond, Core Muni, and ST Muni funds (the “PCS Funds”) merged into American Funds, which may or may not continue to be held in the portfolio(s). Your holdings in the PCS Funds
will continue to be reflected in the Total Account, Total Account (Net), Total Account – Managed and Fixed-Income - Managed asset class return calculation(s), as applicable. However, the PCS Funds will not be reflected as an
individual segment on the Investment Results reports post the merger date.
Where applicable, returns for funds such as the Capital Group Alternative Strategies Fund may not be available in a timely manner due to lags in pricing.
