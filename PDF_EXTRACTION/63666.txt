3/5|  Important information regarding inducements Emmanouil Spyridakis

Client number

(see section 27 of the General Terms of Business of Bank J. Safra Sarasin Ltd)

Reference date
20.02.2024
Reference currency
EUR
This information provides an overview of payments, discounts or other monetary and non-monetary benefits (together referred to as "Inducements") which Bank J. Safra
Sarasin Ltd (the “Bank”) may receive from product providers (including Group companies of the Bank) in connection with the distribution of financial instruments and other
services. Such Inducements compensate the Bank for its distribution efforts and expenses and for other services to product providers. The client expressly waives any claim
to receive such Inducements where the Bank would be required to hand these over to the client under Article 400 of the Swiss Code of Obligations or other regulations. The
Bank is therefore entitled to keep such Inducements in full.

Portfolio
6.36621.9 6000
Inducements are either granted by external product providers or by Group companies of the Bank. They are generally granted in connection with the acquisition or
distribution of collective investment schemes (the "Investment Funds"), structured products or other products. The level of Inducements may vary according to the product
and product provider in question and may be subject to change. The following overview shows the currently applicable ranges for such Inducements.

Inducements for Investment Funds (approximate ranges for the most common categories)
In connection with the distribution of Investment Funds, the amount of Inducements is typically dependent on the volume of shares/units of the Investment Fund held by
the Bank in the client accounts. They are generally within the following ranges (p.a.):

Category Range of possible payments

Money market funds 0 - 1 %
Bond funds 0 – 2 %
Equity and portfolio funds 0 – 2.5 %
Other funds (real estate, alternative investments etc.) 0 – 3 %

Inducements for structured products
In the case of structured products, Inducements are generally granted on a one-off basis via a discount on the issue price, as payment of part of the issue price, or in the
form of a co-structuring fee. Payments generally range between 0 % and 5 % of the issue price.

Inducements for other products
Inducements may also be received in the course of business transactions conducted with other products (such as certain fiduciary investments). Such payments are
generally calculated on the basis of the average volume held by the Bank. The range of Inducements is generally between 0 % and 2 % (p.a.).

Other non-monetary benefits
In addition to, or instead of the Inducements described above, the Bank may receive other non-monetary benefits from product providers, such as financial analyses
provided free of charge, training of employees or measures to facilitate sales.
